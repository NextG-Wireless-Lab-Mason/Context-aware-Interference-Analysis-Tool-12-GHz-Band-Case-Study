# Context-aware Interference Analysis Tool - Case Study of 12 GHz Band
**#ProJect Overview:**
  This project proposes a holistic, multi-disciplinary, context-aware spectrum-sharing approach to address the spectrum coexistence of broadband wireless systems in satellite bands. In this work, we develop a realistic simulation-based interference evaluation framework for the 12 GHz band.
